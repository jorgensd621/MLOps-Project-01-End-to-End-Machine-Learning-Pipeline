# MLOps Project 01 - End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline 

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) for data and model versioning, and MLflow for experiment tracking. 

The pipeline focuses on training a Random Forest Classifier on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, with clear stages for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools/Technologies used for Project
Following tools have been used to complete the project. 
1. Git / GitHub / GitLab
2. DagsHub
3. DVC
4. MLFlow

### Data Version Control (DVC):
- DVC is used to track and version the dataset, models, and pipeline stages, ensuring reproducibility across different environments.
- The pipeline is structured into stages (**preprocessing**, **training**, **evaluation**) that can be automatically re-executed if any dependencies change (e.g., data, scripts, or parameters).
- DVC also allows remote data storage (e.g., DagsHub, S3) for large datasets and models.

### Experiment Tracking with MLflow:
- MLflow is used to track experiment metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- It logs the hyperparameters of the model (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth) and performance metrics like accuracy.
- MLflow helps compare different runs and models to optimize the machine learning pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages

### Preprocessing:

- The preprocess.py script reads the raw dataset (data/raw/data.csv), performs basic preprocessing (such as renaming columns), and outputs the processed data to data/processed/data.csv.
- This stage ensures that data is consistently processed across runs.

### Training:

- The train.py script trains a Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.
- The model is saved as models/random_forest.pkl.
- Hyperparameters and the model itself are logged into MLflow for tracking and comparison.

### Evaluation:

- The evaluate.py script loads the trained model and evaluates its performance (accuracy) on the dataset.
- The evaluation metrics are logged to MLflow for tracking.



## Goals
- **Reproducibility:** By using DVC, the pipeline ensures that the same data, parameters, and code can reproduce the same results, making the workflow reliable and consistent.
- **Experimentation:** MLflow allows users to easily track different experiments (with varying hyperparameters) and compare the performance of models.
- **Collaboration:** DVC and MLflow enable smooth collaboration in a team environment, where different users can work on the same project and track changes seamlessly.

### For Adding DVC Stages

### Bash Commands
```
dvc stage add -n preprocess \
    -p preprocess.input,preprocess.output \
    -d src/preprocess.py -d data/raw/data.csv \
    -o data/processed/data.csv \
    python src/preprocess.py
```	
	
```
dvc stage add -n train \
    -p train.data,train.model,train.random_state,train.n_estimators,train.max_depth \
    -d src/train.py -d data/raw/data.csv \
    -o models/model.pkl \
    python src/train.py
```	

```
dvc stage add -n evaluate \
    -d src/evaluate.py -d models/model.pkl -d data/raw/data.csv \
    python src/evaluate.py
```

### Windows Commands
```
dvc stage add -n preprocess -p preprocess.input,preprocess.output -d src/preprocess.py -d data/raw/data.csv -o data/processed/data.csv python src/preprocess.py
```	
	
```
